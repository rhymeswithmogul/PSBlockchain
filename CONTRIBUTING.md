# Contributing to PSBlockchain

All contributors and contributions are welcome!  Before you take part in this project, please review this document, as well as the code of conduct.

## Reporting a bug
Please submit an issue if you find a bug.  Provide steps on how to reproduce the issue, a test case, and be sure to mention what version of PowerShell you're using.

If you're reporting an issue *and* you know how to code in PowerShell, feel free to submit a pull request that fixes the issue.

## Coding standards
Any code you contribute **must** run equally well on:
- Windows PowerShell 5
- PowerShell Core 6 (the latest version)
- PowerShell 7 (the latest preview version)

As classes were introduced in PowerShell 5.0, you do not need to (nor are you able to) test on earlier versions.

Please write readable code, and document your work if needed.  You do not need to (but you may) write comment-based help for class methods, as PowerShell does not support those at this time.

When you're writing blocks of text like help documents, please wrap your lines at 75 characters when possible.

Thank you for your support!
